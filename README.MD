# Smarter type for the modern web.

Instead of recreating text demos to demonstrate typography features and how to use them, I decided to make this.

It builds on top of [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/). Apologies for some of the spaghetti code and mixed react patterns. 

## How to contribute

All pull requests welcome, especially around the typographic features including copywriting. Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/zaneriley/smartertype.com/issues) for more specifics.
